Angular-To-Do
Hey everbody!

Today we'll be building a To Do List with AngularJS. To do lists are a great way to start with technolgies as they are simple, yet do require enough implementation to understand how the technoligies work.

You should have a single input box and a single button, the button click should add the item in the input box to a list below.

Some of the directives you will use are: * ng-click * ng-model * ng-repeat

Hard Mode
Have a remove button that removes single items once complete.

Pro Mode
Add check boxes to items and allow multiple items to be completed at once.
